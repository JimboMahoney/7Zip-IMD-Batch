# 7Zip-IMD-Batch

Created to help backup data from a CyTOF system (Windows)

I needed a method to quickly compress the IMD files on a Fluidigm CyTOF (Helios) system so they could be more effectively backed up.

IMD files are VERY large (typically 10s of GBS) but compress well (e.g. 90%).

Thanks to Samuel Granjeaud for some help improving the script!
